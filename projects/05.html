  <meta name="description" content="Habitation is a nomadic site-specific project created by artist Hui-Ying Tsai. The project explores the concept of home and the modern utopia for human and animals by building a nesting structure in different locations with local materials. The design of each piece involves field study and reflects on the history, environment, and community of the site. Each piece functions as a social hub or habitat for people and animals. The work becomes a monument of the home building process. By collaborating with each community to make art, Project Habitation enhances awareness of the natural and cultural landscapes that responds to the presence of the place.">

        Title: Habitation No.5, 搖籃 (Cradle)<br>

        Cradle is a functional floating sculpture that works as two-sides habitant for life in the wetland. One side is a shelter for birds above water, and the another side is a base habitat to develop an underwater ecosystem. I want to highlight the strength of nature’s ability to self-heal and neutralize life given time and care.<br>

        The main design is a crescent moon symbolizes the beginning of a new cycle. Wetland environment has particularly close relationship tied to the tide action. It will be a 4 meters diameter crescent moon that is 3.2 meters above water and 0.8 meters underwater. A bamboo floating raft (2 meters wide) is built into the structure so it is a mobile device that will sway gently with the tidal action like a cradle singing lullaby. Dimensions are open to discussion and the sketch will be revised on site to work for the actual condition if necessary.<br>

        Main materials for the Cradle include new bamboo (for the flexibility and gradual color change through time), reeds, shells, hemp twine, natural glue, and rope. There will be at least 2 sculpture workshops, 1 material gathering trip, and 1 installation workshop led by artist, Hui-Ying Tsai, to make unique bird nests and oyster clutches. The oyster clutches will reference the lotus lantern carries the meaning of tribute to the passed loved ones and blessing for the livings in Asia culture. The small pieces from the workshops will later be attached to the Cradle together by the creators. Materials for the bird nest  will be shell based but other natural materials are encouraged for creativity.
