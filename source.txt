Description: Habitation is a nomadic site-specific project created by artist Hui-Ying Tsai. The project explores the concept of home and the modern utopia for human and animals by building a nesting structure in different locations with local materials. The design of each piece involves field study and reflects on the history, environment, and community of the site. Each piece functions as a social hub or habitat for people and animals. The work becomes a monument of the home building process. By collaborating with each community to make art, Project Habitation enhances awareness of the natural and cultural landscapes that responds to the presence of the place.
